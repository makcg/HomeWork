All my friends have pets cats and dogs . But my pet is not so usual . I have a turtle and its name is Chuck . My turtle is not big . It is green and brown . Chuck likes to eat fruit and vegetables but I feed it with special turtle food . Chuck is a sea turtle . It lives in an aquarium with water , little stones and sea plants . The aquarium stands near my desk so I can look at Chuck when I do my homework .
